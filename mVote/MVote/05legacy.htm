    style='font-size:18.0pt'>M</span>uch of it, as in Surat or Baroda, is not
    new. Apart from petty traders and groups of Muslim artisans who have carved
    out a place for themselves, the Bohra, Khoja and Memon communities continue
    to play trading and mercantile roles in western enterprise, including two
    cotton-spinning mills in Surat stared in 1861 and 1874, Ahmedabad had no
    Muslim mill-owners, and only one industrialist, Munshi Fateh Mohammad Fakir
    Mohammad, who started a match factory in 1895. </p>
    <p>The situation improved over the decades because the textile and
    transport industries expanded, attracting large numbers of Muslim migrants
    into the city. Though still relatively backward in most sectors of the
    economy, especially in the professions and in private and government
    employment, Muslims in Ahmedabad have made their mark in textiles,
    transport, petty trading and shopkeeping. </p>
    <p>The overall progress of the Kerala Muslims is aided by Gulf employment,
    reservations in education and higher rates of literacy achieved through
    sustained application. Farook College at Calicut in the Malabar region,
    from its humble beginnings in 1947-8, generated constructive movements of
    modernity and progress among the Kerala Muslims; it has been called 'the
    Aligarh of the south.' </p>
    <p>Along with other voluntary agencies, the Muslim Educational Society,
    founded in 1964, promotes primary, secondary and higher education. By 1960,
    46.3 per cent of school-age Muslim children were attending school; by 1970,
    Mapillas accounted for 30 per cent of college students in Malappuram and Calicut
    districts. At the beginning of 1974, about 700 lower and upper primary
    schools and 36 high schools flourished under Muslim management. In the
    state as a whole, there were nine first-grade Muslim colleges and several
    technical institutions. </p>
    <p>The fortunes of the Kerala Muslim migrants to Madras city have improved
    since the 1940s when they first entered the metropolis. Those from the
    Malabar region did particularly well in running hotels, biscuit factories,
    textile concerns and import-export firms. A Muslim timber merchant who came
    to the city penniless now owns one of the largest timber firms in south
    India with twenty branches in Madras city. </p>
    <p>The Malabar Muslim Association has reason to be proud of its
    achievements. It set up a medical relief centre, primary and secondary
    schools and colleges. The Islamic Foundation in Madras founded an
    engineering college in 1984 in the name and style of the Saleh Kamel
    Crescent Engineering College at Othivakam in Chengalpatlu district. The
    Al-Ameen Educational Society in Bangalore founded colleges, an evening
    polytechnic (1977) and a school of pharmacy (1982). In 1984 the society
    awarded scholarships amounting to Rs 89,745,63. </p>
    <p>The picture is much less promising in UP and Bihar. These states have
    some isolated pockets of affluence, but on the whole a rather alarming
    percentage of the minorities, particularly the poorer sections among the
    Muslims, live in these states. The country's partition and the sheer scale
    and magnitude of migration of Pakistan from traditional Muslims centres
    like Delhi, Aligarh, Farrukhabad, Moradabad, Rampur, Meerut, Mufaffarnagar,
    Lucknow and Allahabad contributed to the professional classes being skimmed
    off. The loss has not been made good. </p>
    <p>Zamindari abolition caused serious hardships to small landowners,
    zamindars and their dependants. When Hindi was made the sole language of
    administration and education, the affected sections were the very ones
    which sought employment at the clerical level, in lower government service
    or in educational institutions. </p>
    <p>Indeed, it was difficult for many Muslims whose mother-tongue was Urdu
    to compete for government posts. This, and the constant fear of
    discrimination, largely accounts for so few taking the competitive
    examinations for government posts. </p>
    <p>Widespread illiteracy and a higher drop-out rate at the elementary stage
    are additional factors. According to the Planning Commission, the average
    literacy rate among Muslims was 42 per cent in 1987-8, less than the
    national average of 52.11 per cent. Muslim women -- more than half the
    total Muslim population -- do not receive even school education, let alone
    higher education. </p>
    <p>A survey conducted in 1967-8 in Lucknow showed that illiteracy among
    Hindu women was 32 per cent compared to 50 per cent among Muslim women.
    None of the latter who responded had a post-graduate degree. Most of the
    husbands of the 1,423 women surveyed also had not attended a school. On the
    other hand, 80 per cent or more of the upper-caste Hindus and Christians
    had received secondary or higher education. </p>
    <p>The educational profile of Muslims is much lower in Khurja and
    Bulandshahr, though they constitute numerically one of the dominant groups
    along with scheduled castes. The number of Muslims who study in Khurja is
    about 10 per cent (the corresponding figure for women was 5 per cent) while
    of Hindus about 75 per cent. </p>
    <p>It is not clear whether Muslim children are not sent to schools and
    colleges because of economic constraints, the absence of religious
    instruction, the sting of the prevailing bias against Urdu, or because
    parents in larger arts and crafts centres hardly consider it worthwhile to
    give their children higher education. What is evident is the lack of
    concerted effort in UP, though less so in Bihar, to promote literacy or
    modernise existing educational institutions. Initiatives in Delhi by the
    Hamdard Foundation or the Crescent School are modest compared to the scale
    of similar operations in Bihar, and west and south India. </p>
    <p>The Dini Talimi (Religious Education) Council of UP had 6,000 small
    rural schools in which more than 600,000 pupils received religious
    instruction. Studies by A R Sherwani, whose brother was a prominent
    industrialist in Allahabad, indicate that instruction in such schools
    seldom goes beyond Class II and that the educational content is confined
    almost exclusively to Islamic religious texts. Urdu-medium schools, mostly
    government-run, teach physics, chemistry, mathematics, geography and
    economics, but Sherwani shows that such institutions fail to maintain the
    standards of Hindi-medium schools, either in UP or Delhi. Some schools have
    modified their curriculum, but most have not. </p>
    <p>Take Karnataka's largest seminary on the outskirts of Bangalore. More
    than 400 boys, mainly from south India, are trained to lead prayers, recite
    the Quran and teach in <em>makatib </em>and <em>madaris.</em> But the
    curriculum has not changed, because of the traditions handed down from
    previous generations: 'There are great spiritual blessings to be had from
    ancient wisdom which modern education is totally bereft of.' </p>
    <p>The library is stocked with books, but only on Islam and in Persian,
    Arabic and Urdu languages. Maulvi Haroon, as a recent graduate, had not
    heard of liberal and modernist authors; they find no place in the
    institution. The glass doors of the cupboards are covered all over with
    colourful stickers, all conveying in different ways the same message: 'No
    to the Uniform Civil Code' </p>
    <p>In sum, what the students are taught and the fashion in which their
    tender minds are moulded, time seems to have frozen here many centuries
    ago. </p>
    <p>The great seminaries at Deoband and Lucknow, which should ideally have
    given the lead, are sluggish in responding to the winds of change. The few
    cosmetic changes introduced in their curriculum have not helped to equip
    their graduates to compete in the wider world of employment, trade or
    business; many end up as school teachers or prayer-leaders in local
    mosques. Aligarh and Jamia Millia have attracted some bright students
    largely through a liberal admission policy, but their numbers are small and
    with a few notable exceptions their performance has been disappointing. </p>
    <p>The GSC report found students at Nadwa totally devoid of modern secular
    education which is essential to help them face the realities outside. The
    Jamia Millia and Aligarh Muslim University have not lived up to their
    reputation. </p>
    <p>The Jamia, founded in the year of great political upheaval is rocked by
    mounting corruption, misguided student agitations, increasing
    administrative lapses and strained teacher-students relations. </p>

    alt=Muslims v:shapes="_x0000_s1029"><![endif]>The university at Aligarh
    seethed with discontent caused by corruption, declining academic standards
    and inept administration. Other institutions, such as the Shia College in
    Lucknow, are little better.The Dar-al-Mussaniffin, Shibli Nomani's
    creation, languishes in Azamgarh, and Lucknow's Firangi Mahal, situated in
    Chowk, is a symbol of the Nawabi city's decline. Declining standards and
    financial mismanagement plague the once renowned Faiz Aam Inter-College in
    Meerut. </p>
    <p>If so few go to school and college and if so many are inadequately
    equipped to face the world, it is easy to understand why only 5,336 (2.59
    per cent) Muslims competed for the subordinate services commission
    examinations and so few found employment in the judicial, administrative,
    police and forest services. Figures furnished by the GSC report or <em>Muslim
    India</em> need to be updated, although the pattern is likely to remain
    much the same for many years to come. By and large, Muslims are like to
    remain outside the area of state employment and predominantly in the
    unorganised sector either as workers or as self-employed petty bourgeoisie.
    </p>
    <p>Muslim organisations have not diagnosed the malady, but they need to do
    so. They must review the performance and functioning of educational
    institutions, including Aligarh, Deoband, Nadwa and Jamia Millia Islamia,
    and improve the working of huge numbers of charitable endowments which had
    once sustained vigorous and creative intellectual life at several urban
    centres. </p>
